# EdgeExtension
A very simple edge extension based on the sample in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions/guides/creating-an-extension
Changes the color of tabs in docs.microsoft.com to Orange and Green and Resets to its former color.

Unlike the sample application, the extension will not be disabled in play.google.com as permission has been added to the manifest.
The popup has 'Calibri' font with white as the foreground and black as the background colors.
